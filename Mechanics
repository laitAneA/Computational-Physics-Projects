### The Lagrangian of a Simple Pendulum
The dynamics of the system are described by the Lagrangian $L$, defined as the difference between kinetic energy ($T$) and potential energy ($V$):

$$L = T - V = \frac{1}{2}ml^2\dot{\theta}^2 + mgl\cos\theta$$

Where:
- $m$ is the mass of the bob
- $l$ is the length of the rod
- $\dot{\theta}$ is the angular velocity
